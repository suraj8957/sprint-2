# Generic CI Operation – License Scanning Documentation
## Introduction:
In modern CI/CD pipelines, organizations use multiple open-source libraries and third-party dependencies. Every dependency comes with a software license (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.), which defines how it can be used, modified, and distributed.

License Scanning in CI ensures that:

- No prohibited licenses are used

- Legal risks are minimized

- Compliance is automated before production deployment

License scanning is part of DevSecOps practices and is integrated into Continuous Integration pipelines.
